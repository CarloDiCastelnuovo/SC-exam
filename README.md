## Title

The aim of this project is visualize whatever dataframe in which I have the first two columns filled with position data ('x', 'y') and the rest of them filled with some values i want to visualize. Furthermore the code estimate the close points for every pixel and compute the mean value of it, generating smoother images.
The last step is a clustering phase in which the code estimate for every pixel the belonging to one or another cluster, with two different metodologies: the K-means and the Guassian Mixture Model.
In the end there will be 4 different subplots for every data columns.
